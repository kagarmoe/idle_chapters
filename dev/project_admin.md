# Project Administration

## Conventional commits

Use Conventional Commits for all changes. Format:

```
type(scope): short summary
```

Allowed types (common): `feat`, `fix`, `chore`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`.
Add a `!` for breaking changes and note details in the body.

## GitHub project

Track work in the GitHub project board:
https://github.com/users/kagarmoe/projects/1/

## Proposed issue labels

Use these labels as axes for triage and planning:

- Estimate: Small, Medium, Large
- Value: Low, Medium, High
- Appeal: Low, Medium, High
- Human↔AI: Human, Human+, Hybrid, AI+, AI

## Labeling rules of thumb

- Estimate reflects effort and uncertainty; size up when core dependencies are unknown.
- Value reflects user impact or strategic importance, not personal interest.
- Appeal reflects motivation; use Low for chores or draining work even if high-value.
- Human↔AI reflects authorship: Human for manual or research-heavy, AI for fully specifiable, Hybrid for shared creation.
