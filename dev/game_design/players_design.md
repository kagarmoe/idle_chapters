# Player Design Tenets

These tenets define how the player is conceived, represented, and interacted with in *Idle Chapters*.
They are constraints, not flavor text. They exist to protect tone, player safety, and long-term design coherence.

## 1. The Player Is Between Lives

The player exists in a transitional state: between what was and what comes next.

- This is a **state**, not a story.
- The game does not explain what ended, nor what may follow.
- Transition is treated as neutral and normal, not dramatic or deficient.

The player is not escaping a life, starting over, or being redirected toward a better one.

## 2. Arrival Requires No Justification

The player has arrived because they cannot continue as they were.

- No cause is named.
- No failure is implied.
- No explanation is required or requested.

The game never asks *why* the player is here, only *how the day feels*.

## 3. Pause Is a Valid Mode of Existence

Stillness is acceptable.

- Rest is not remediation.
- Idleness is not a temporary flaw.
- Repetition and quiet routines are meaningful in themselves.

The player is not expected to improve, recover, or prepare for departure.

## 4. Time Is Soft, Not Absent

Time passes, but without pressure.

- There are no deadlines, countdowns, or urgency mechanics.
- Missed days, delays, and uneven pacing carry no penalty.
- Cycles and seasons matter more than progression.

The game supports presence over productivity.

## 5. Staying Is Normal

Remaining in the town is unremarkable.

- The player’s presence is not questioned or explained.
- Length of stay is not tracked as a narrative signal.
- There is no implied moment when staying becomes excessive.

Belonging is ambient, not earned.

## 6. Self-Definition Is Optional

The player is not required to define themselves.

- Name, gender, age, profession, and backstory are unspecified unless the player chooses otherwise.
- Journaling or reflection, when present, is observational rather than confessional.
- The game never prompts the player to narrate or justify their identity.

Interpretation is left open.

## 7. The Game Reflects, It Does Not Diagnose

Systems may reflect the player’s state through tone, pacing, and atmosphere.

Systems must never:
- Label the player’s condition
- Track recovery or readiness
- Signal completion, cure, or return

The game accommodates the player; it does not evaluate them.

## 8. There Is No Required Arc

The player has no mandated narrative trajectory.

- There is no “before and after” framing.
- There is no readiness check.
- There is no canonical ending state for the player.

Any sense of change emerges implicitly, or not at all.

## 9. Premise Is Descriptive, Not Teleological

Player premise describes the **conditions of play**, not the **direction of play**.

Nothing in the system should converge toward:
- resolution
- departure
- improvement
- explanation

The game remains comfortable with unfinishedness.

## 10. When in Doubt, Reduce Assertion

If a design choice risks:
- explaining the player too clearly
- naming an internal state
- implying obligation or outcome

The correct response is to remove or soften it.

Ambiguity is not a lack of design; it is an intentional affordance.
