# Cozy games

## Mechanics

- player-paced
- lax time elements, when they exist
- no punishment for falling behind
- cooperation, collaboration, community

Intrinsic mechanics: things are enjoyable for themselves.
You don't feel guilty for not doing something
Shopping, fishing, organizing

Frog Vibes says:

- Remove risk and stress
- Silliness (fun)
- Story about new beginning and processing the past
- Lot of open-ended gameplay within episodes, many jokes

## Narratives

- Grounded themes. Even the magical is mundane (running a spell shop)
- Centers on having space/time for self or others (Stardew Valley )
- Connection , to others, to locations, to objects. (There's a packing game!)
- Inclusivity/gentle optimism - comfort of diverse people just being respected defacto.

## Cozy as a genre

Genre is loosely understood a setting, narrative, art style, and (camera) perspective

Cozy games are now stakes and comforting.

Zoe Bee argues that cozy games are largely simulation games (Sims, Stardew Valley)

Design Doc says:

- Low-pressure game play without a lot of conscequences for bailing on a task
- Simple stylistic visuals
- Fun characters
- Light story (even no story)

Key items are bountiful.
No combat, bountiful resources, pause spots

### Setting

Tend to be either "at home" or "in nature". Some have 3rd spaces

### Narrative

Abundance, familiarity, belonging.
Emphasis on the mundane
