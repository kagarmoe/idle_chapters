# Interaction Design

This document defines how the player interacts with the world and its inhabitants in *Idle Chapters*.
It focuses on interaction structure, NPC interaction behavior, and how player premise facets bias interaction tone.

This document does not restate global tone rules. Any language prohibitions belong in `tone_contract.md`.

## 1. Interaction Philosophy

Interactions in *Idle Chapters* are designed to:

- Acknowledge presence without interrogating motive
- Offer contact without obligation
- Allow repetition without escalation
- Accumulate meaning through familiarity, not plot

Interactions should feel complete even when nothing changes.

## 2. Interaction Types (Structural)

All interactions must fit one of the following structural types.

### 2.1 Ambient Acknowledgment

**Description**
Unprompted, low-intensity lines that acknowledge the player’s presence or the state of the world.

**Characteristics**

- No questions
- No requests
- No implied next step

**Examples (structural)**

- Observations of weather, light, sound
- Neutral remarks about quiet or routine

Ambient acknowledgments should never advance relationships or unlock content.

### 2.2 Micro-Offers

**Description**
Small, reversible offers that the player may accept or decline without consequence.

**Characteristics**

- Binary or minimal choice
- Declining is emotionally neutral
- Acceptance does not create obligation

**Examples (structural)**

- Offering tea, a seat, or a brief activity
- Invitations phrased without expectation

Micro-offers are about permission, not engagement depth.

### 2.3 Ritual Interactions

**Description**
Repeatable interactions whose meaning deepens through familiarity rather than progression.

**Characteristics**

- Identical or near-identical structure on repetition
- Minor variation in phrasing or timing
- No completion state

**Examples (structural)**

- Daily greetings
- Repeated shared activities
- Seasonal or cyclical acknowledgments

Rituals are allowed to feel comforting or grounding, but never corrective.

### 2.4 Light Requests

**Description**
Small requests initiated by NPCs that relate to their needs, not the player’s state.

**Characteristics**

- Optional participation
- Requests are modest and contextually grounded
- Rewards are relational or atmospheric, not evaluative

**Examples (structural)**

- Asking for an ingredient or object
- Requesting presence rather than action


Light requests must never imply that helping improves the player.

#### Directional Guidance (Permitted)

NPCs may provide gentle, matter-of-fact guidance toward items or locations when making light requests.

Permitted forms:

- Locative hints (“by the river”, “through the hedge”, “near the old wall”)
- Descriptive orientation (“where the ground stays damp”, “past the low stones”)

Constraints:

- Guidance must not read as instruction or optimization
- Directions must remain optional and non-exhaustive
- No implication that the player is expected to act immediately, correctly, or at all

Directional guidance exists to support exploration, not task completion.

### 2.5 Threshold / Portal-Adjacent Interactions

**Description**
Interactions that occur near portals, boundaries, or moments of transition.

**Characteristics**

- Reflective rather than directive
- No timing pressure
- No readiness framing

**Examples (structural)**

- Observations about doors, paths, or crossings
- Statements that normalize delay or return

These interactions reinforce liminality without resolving it.

## 3. NPC Address Rules

Forms of address are generated by NPCs and reflect NPC disposition, not player identity.

### 3.1 Address Is Relational, Not Declarative

- NPCs choose whether to use a form of address.
- Different NPCs may address the player differently without narrative implication.
- No form of address should imply closeness, authority, or obligation by default.



### 3.2 Address Must Be Grammatically Optional

All NPC dialogue using a vocative must:
- Remain syntactically complete if the interaction is removed
- Avoid anchoring meaning on the interaction itself

Valid pattern:
- “You’re welcome to stay{, friend}.”

Invalid pattern:
- “Friend, tell me why you’re here.”



### 3.3 Interaction Frequency Guidelines

NPCs may follow different interactions styles:
- **None**: never uses vocatives
- **Sparse**: uses player name/pronouns in greetings or comfort
- **Habitual**: uses gentle player name/pronouns regularly

Interaction frequency should not escalate as a reward signal.

### 3.4 Interaction Pools

Each NPC should have a small, fixed pool of allowable interactions.
Pools should be thematically consistent with the NPC’s role and tone.

 pools must never include:
- Diagnostic language
- Readiness or completion signals
- Familial or possessive claims

## 4. Premise → Interaction Bias Mapping

Player premise facets bias *which interaction variants surface*, not which interactions are allowed.

Biasing must be:

- Subtle
- Reversible
- Non-exclusive

No interaction should require a specific premise state.

### 4.1 Example Bias Relationships (Conceptual)

- Higher **pause_is_valid**
  - Increased likelihood of ambient acknowledgments
  - Preference for stillness-oriented ritual phrasing

- Higher **time_is_soft**
  - Increased seasonal and cyclical language
  - Reduced use of temporal sequencing (“next”, “later”)

- Higher **between_lives**
  - Increased threshold metaphors
  - More portal-adjacent interaction variants

- Higher **stay_is_normal**
  - NPC dialogue normalizing presence
  - Fewer novelty-oriented remarks

### 4.2 What Bias Must Never Do

Premise bias must never:

- Lock or unlock interaction types
- Signal improvement or decline
- Be surfaced explicitly to the player

Bias affects tone selection only.

## 5. Relationship to Tone Contract

This document assumes compliance with `tone_contract.md`.

If an interaction concept:

- Requires banning a phrase globally
- Introduces a new class of forbidden implication
- Risks contradicting player design tenets

It must be resolved by updating the tone contract, not this document.

## 6. Design Check (Quick Review)

Before adding a new interaction, confirm:

- Does it fit a defined interaction type?
- Can it repeat indefinitely without escalation?
- Can all player_info terms be removed cleanly?
- Does it describe state rather than direction?
- Does it remain valid if the player never changes?

If not, reduce assertion or reclassify the interaction.
