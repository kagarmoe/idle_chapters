# Cozy Game Tone Contract

## Status

**Authoritative design constraint**

This document defines the emotional, linguistic, and experiential boundaries of the game.
All generated and authored content **must comply** with this contract.

Breaking the tone contract is considered a **design error**, not a creative choice.

## 1. Purpose

This game exists to provide:

- Emotional safety
- Gentle curiosity
- Restorative presence

The player is never tested, judged, rushed, or placed at risk.
Variation exists to sustain interest, not to create tension.

The game prioritizes **restoration over progression**.

## 2. Core Emotional Promise

At all times, the game promises the player:

- You are allowed to be where you are.
- Nothing bad will happen because you waited, looked, or chose slowly.
- There is no “right” way to experience a place.
- Small moments are sufficient.

The game does not require completion, mastery, or optimization.

## 3. What the Game Will Never Ask of the Player

The game will **never** require:

- Urgency or speed
- Optimization, evaluation, or comparison
- Fear, threat, or vigilance
- Social performance or embarrassment
- Resource anxiety or scarcity management
- Irreversible loss
- Moral judgment or correctness

The player is never *behind*, *at fault*, or *at risk*.

## 4. Place-Based Emotional Design

Each place in the game exists to satisfy **one gentle human need**, defined explicitly as: `player_need_satisfied`.

Examples include:

- Permission to rest and recover
- Permission to notice small wonders
- Reassurance of belonging
- Support in making choices calmly

Places:

- Offer emotional states, not outcomes
- Do not escalate or resolve conflicts
- Do not unlock consequences

A place is complete the moment the player enters it.

## 5. Tone Boundaries (Hard Constraints)

The following are globally disallowed in all generated content:

### 5.1 Threat & Danger

- Threat, danger, peril, violence, injury
- Menacing animals or environments

### 5.2 Urgency & Pressure

- Deadlines, rushing, time pressure
- “Must,” “urgent,” or failure framing

### 5.3 Scarcity & Loss

- Shortage, depletion, “last chance”
- Irreversible loss or destruction

### 5.4 Social Tension

- Judgment, scrutiny, embarrassment
- Authority, enforcement, punishment

### 5.5 Harsh Sensory Language

- Screeching, crashing, sharpness
- Extreme weather or bodily discomfort

If language violates these constraints, it is **omitted**, not replaced with contrast or drama.

## 6. Tone Enforcement (Soft Constraints)

Tone is enforced through **lexicon weighting**, not scripting.

This means:

- Language is biased probabilistically, not dictated
- Word choice subtly aligns with `Player_Need_Satisfied`
- Emotional drift is corrected gently over time

The system prioritizes **consistency of feeling**, not textual novelty.

## 7. Allowed Emotional Range

The game allows the following emotional states:

- Calm
- Curiosity
- Nostalgia
- Quiet reflection
- Gentle melancholy

The game does **not** allow:

- Despair
- Anxiety about the future
- Regret framed as error
- Grief requiring resolution

## 8. Melancholy Guidelines

### 8.1 Allowed Melancholy (“Settled”)

Melancholy is permitted when it is:

- Past-facing, not future-facing
- Accepting, not yearning
- Quiet, not sharp
- Observational, not participatory

Examples:

- Wear
- Fading
- Distance
- Time having passed

Melancholy must **settle**, not pull.

### 8.2 Disallowed Melancholy (“Pulling”)

Disallowed forms include:

- Regret framed as mistake
- Longing framed as loss
- Sadness that implies action is required
- “If only,” “too late,” or “missed chance” language

If an emotion asks the player to act, fix, or resolve, it breaks the tone contract.

## 9. Player Trust

The tone contract is a trust agreement:

- The world is emotionally safe
- The system never surprises the player with threat or obligation
- Variation reinforces familiarity rather than disruption

The player should learn, implicitly, that:
> Nothing bad will happen if they stay.

## 10. Validation Checklist

When evaluating any generated or authored content, confirm:

1. Is the player emotionally safe here?
2. Is nothing required of them?
3. Does the moment feel complete as-is?

If all three are **yes**, the tone contract is upheld.

## 11. Design Authority

This document overrides:

- Individual prose choices
- Local narrative flavor
- Isolated generation outputs

All systems must conform to this contract.
