    Incantation generation guidance (rhymed couplet default):
    - Write 2–6 lines as rhyming couplets (AABB…).
    - Keep an accentual feel (about 4 strong beats per line); syllable count may vary slightly.
    - Allow the final line of each couplet to vary in length or cadence (extra syllable or clipped ending) for comic timing.
    - Tone should match the spell's `tone` and `narrative_purpose`.
    - MUST pass lexicon validation: avoid any disallowed terms from the project's not_allowed_lexicon; follow house-style constraints.
    - Keep language cozy-safe (no graphic harm, threats, or unsafe instructions).
